# MeriSKILL-Internship-Sales-Analysis-Project
Developed a dynamic sales analysis dashboard utilizing Power BI, enabling the visualization of sales trends, top-selling products, and revenue measures. The dashboard provided actionable insights for informed decision-making and strategic business growth.

## Project Structure:
- Data: Contains the raw data files used for analysis.
- Scripts: Includes any scripts or code used in the data transformation process.
- Visualizations: Stores the Power BI files and exported images of visualizations.
- Docs: Documentation files, including this README.

## Insights:
In order to come up with this visualization, I used Power Query Editor in Power Bi to initially transform unorganized data before creating this visualization. Then, using the order date column, I generated the calculative column for the month name, month number, day name, and day number.
- Created a "Month Name" column from the date column in order to view monthly analysis.
- Created a "Day Name" column from the date column to identify the days of the week products were purchased.

## Key Learnings:
In this visualization, we could identify:
- Sales Trend: The line graph indicates that December had highest sales figures. This can be as a result of the December holiday and practice of exchanging gifts.
- Top selling products: We can identify which are the top 5 selling products by using a bar chart.
- We may determine revenue and the revenue measure by calculating the sales quantity and profit margin using KPIs. This indicates that this year's profit was high.
- Also did some additional analysis to find out top 5 cities by sales using the map visual and top 5 products by sales using the tree map.
